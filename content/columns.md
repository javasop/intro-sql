### Columns

- Equivalent to instance variables in Ruby.

- In our Previous example: name, age, gender are columns.

- We can add new attributes to an already created table.

- Remember everything is permanently stored. We don't reset our application and start over again.


## in SQL

if we wanted to add a column to an already existing table

```sql

ALTER TABLE Student
ADD graduated boolean

```
